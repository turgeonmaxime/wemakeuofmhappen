Over $23M in new research funds over the last 5 years.

We are successful entrepreneurs. Collectively we have had tremendous success, already securing millions of dollars in provincial, federal, and international grant dollars for research, infrastructure and hiring. We are using these funds to start innovative research programs that will bring exponentially more money into the province in the upcoming years.
