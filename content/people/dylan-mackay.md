### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2018

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university? 

I do human nutrition research, mostly clinical trials focused on diabetes and chronic kidney disease. 

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I hope to build a world class nutrition clinical trials program that is integrated into the health care system in Manitoba so that the people of Manitoba (and others around the world) are getting the best evidence informed care related to nutrition and chronic disease.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

When I was 13 years old I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This has greatly  highlighted the importance of food, lifestyle, and economic means on my health. It also led me to become interested in researching these influences. I love the ability to set up and then answer important health related questions that could improve peoples' lives. I also like that I can do this while being able to teach and mentor the next generations of healthcare workers and researchers in Canada.
