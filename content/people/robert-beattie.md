### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2021

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university? 

I only recently began at the University of Manitoba in August, 2021. I brought with me new technologies and approaches to dissect health and disease at single-cell resolution.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

My research laboratory will bring MADM technology for the first time to Canada. This will provide students in my lab with a unique opportunity to use state-of-the-art technology to answer questions in stem cell biology at single-cell resolution in vivo. 

I intend to make my lab a training environment that is welcoming to students of all backgrounds. However, to foster diversity, one must acknowledge the systemic disadvantages some students experience and provide additional support when needed. Our strength as a university lies in our diversity and I intend to build on this. I aim to provide full support for programs on campus related to equity, diversity, and inclusion, ensuring that students from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented minorities can share in the joy of discovery. I aim to create an inclusive and accessible learning environment in the lab, classroom, and all aspects of campus life. 

I did not join the U of M with the intention of leaving shortly after. Instead, I see this place as a great opportunity to do world-class research, grow as an educator and be an active member of the community.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I wanted to be a researcher since I was 10 yo; I most enjoy trying to answer puzzling research questions about human genetics and epidemiology.

Having begun my first academic position only three months ago, this is not how I imagined it playing out. I do not want to be spending this time on strike, at what should be the most productive years of my career. Instead, I want to help make this university more successful than ever. I want to be in the classroom, inspiring a new generations of students. I want to be in my lab making new breakthroughs. However, before we can achieve any of that, we need to work together as one. We know Winnipeg is one great city. All we are asking for is your support. We need to ensure that we can continue to be competitive, recruit world-class academics, and keep talent here in Manitoba.
