GSK Research Chair in Immunology of Infectious Diseases

### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2020

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

Through my research program, I will train multiple undergraduate and graduate students and staff each year. This includes applying for and obtaining local, provincial and national grant funding. Our overall goal is to gain a better understanding of how immune responses are regulated during a viral infection, after vaccination or during periods of chronic inflammation. This includes studying a new potential treatment for mild COVID-19 which could be applied to future pandemic respiratory viruses. I will also be a guest lecturer for immunology courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. I look forward to continuing to participate in outreach events related to promotion of women in science and engaging youth in Manitoba interested in careers in science.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I knew early on I loved the idea of figuring out how things worked and especially liked biology in high school. After taking immunology and virology classes in university, I was fascinated how we have evolved so many intricate ways to fight off viruses and other pathogens both immediately and long term through the formation of memory cells. As I have told past trainees I worked with, it is spending that first time in a lab outside a class with your own project where you see if research as a career is right for you keeping an open mind and being excited discovering something for the first time. Although this dream job keep me very busy, I am especially excited to be a 1) teacher/mentor in the classroom and lab, 2) leader of a research program that has translational potential to help people around the world, 3) science communicator through writing and presentations to other researchers and the public.
