### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

2015 as a sessional - 2021 Instructor II

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

Teaching! I regularly teach upwards of 350 students a year in my 7 courses. 

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I would love to create a legal studies/criminal justice/human rights student exchange program with the University of Wisconsin - Madison to open the eyes of both groups of students to the legal systems of the other country.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I was always fascinated by crime and intrigued by the role of society in crime and criminal behaviour. I also love to teach and am passionate about helping my students achieve their goals. Teaching is my favourite part of my job.
