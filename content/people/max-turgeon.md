### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2019

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

We are in a data revolution, where data analytic and computing skills are in high demand. I contribute to the University by teaching courses in statistical computing and data science. I also train undergraduate and graduate students in those fields, and these students have the perfect skillset to thrive in the knowledge economy.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I want to continue exposing an ever-larger group of students to data analysis and statistics. These skills are in high demand everywhere, from linguistics to anthropology, from biology to business. We can expose these students by creating introductory courses with a focus on computational skills. Even high school students would benefit from being exposed to data science early on!

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I studied Pure Mathematics at first, but for my PhD I really wanted to focus on applied problems. This is how I ended up in Statistics. The reason I chose this particular career, as opposed to working in industry, is that I love teaching. Our students are the best, and they are eager to learn.
