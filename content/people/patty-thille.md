### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2018

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

I am a hybrid scholar, bringing sociological theory and methodologies to the study of health care. In addition to research that aims to improve health care for those with stigmatized conditions, I am educating health care professionals at the masters and PhD levels to become excellent qualitative researchers, and future leaders.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I do research that helps us understand how stigmatization and discrimination occur in health care, and how to disrupt it. I also do research that looks to better utilize health care professionals to their full range of skills within the publicly-funded health care system. I am building toward a research program that engages communities and health care organizations to do this important work, in service of the health and wellbeing of Manitobans.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

My educational path is unusual. First, I became a physiotherapist (BScPT), and later, a sociologist (PhD). I was always drawn to health care, following my mother's example, who worked as a nurse in rural Saskatchewan. While working clinically as a physiotherapist, I had a lot of questions about why we do what we do, and how we might do it better, to better align our services with the needs of the people we see. Those questions took me to the social sciences. 

I aim to act as a bridge between the social and health sciences, and supporting students who wish to do the same, to foster improvements in health care that address current health inequities.

I love that I can now call Winnipeg home, especially because I now live in my mother's hometown (she trained as a nurse at St. Boniface Hospital). I appreciate my big extended family here, living again in a river city, and Winnipeg's thriving arts and culture sector.
