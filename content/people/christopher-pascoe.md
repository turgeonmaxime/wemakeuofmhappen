### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2019

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

Health research in the area of lung disease. Primarily asthma and COPD and the exploring the health impacts of e-cigarette use in young adults. 

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

Generate a better understanding of how the early life environment (the things you are exposed to while in your mother's womb) affect lung health and risk for lung disease later in life. This knowledge will help us develop preventative measures to reduce the burden of lung disease in Canadians

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I love research and exploring the unknown. Being able to collect data that, maybe for the first time, uncovers something no one knew before, its exhilarating.

I chose to join the University of Manitoba because of the great lung research team at the Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba. This research team does cutting edge research that improves the lives of Manitobans living with chronic lung disease. Without adequate funding from the provincial government (Research Manitoba) and competitive salaries and startup packages (University of Manitoba), this research team will struggle to recruit and retain top research talent who can help improve the lives of people in Manitoba.
