### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2021

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

I bring a novel translational and highly collaborative program to the University focused on bench to bedside approaches linking diet and agriculture to microbiome and host response in inflammatory diseases (IBD, RA, MS). My team's translational research further focusses on progression to clinical trials, supporting a number of clinical and research career opportunities in Winnipeg. Our industry/government partnerships allow for product development and advancement of patient care, particularly in inflammatory bowel disease, and offer a great training environment for students who would like to check out career opportunities in research outside of academia during their studies. 

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

Having already established some significant collaborations at the University of Manitoba in my first few months, I aim to improve national level collaboration and engagement at UManitoba, particularly in my area of research. 
As a member of the Manitoba Centre for Proteomics and Systems Biology, I am also eager to promote the use of our services by members of UManitoba and beyond by advertising our capabilities and applying for funding to support the purchase of additional equipment. 
Through my team's research, investigating the specific dietary factors that provide benefit/harm in inflammatory diseases, I hope to both work with academic/industry experts to drive agriculture economics in Manitoba, and provide improved care for those suffering from inflammatory diseases through dietary and microbe-altering interventions. 

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

Interestingly enough I didn't really choose research, it feels more as though research chose me. I had a number of other career goals lined up during my undergraduate studies but due to a number of "right-place right-time" opportunities I was lucky enough to engage in some interesting science along the way and ended up falling in love with research for many reasons: the mental stimulus, the ability to solve problems, and the impact that our research is able to have on a greater number of people globally. I find every day is unique and we're readily able to change things up and investigate new directions which means it never gets old or boring. I also love to travel and while a career in research is definitely hard work, it also provides the flexibility to travel often, meet new people around the world, and enjoy life a little more than other career options may allow for. 
At the end of the day it's really the brilliant, supportive, and collaborative people I met along the way who inspired me to continue with research; and a combination of hard work and Lady luck that got me where I am today.

For anyone interested in a career in research, developing a new collaboration, looking to use our services at the Proteomics and Systems Biology Centre, a good discussion about medicine and beyond, or just in need of a chat and some advice, my door is always open; come say hi!
