### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2018

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

I joined the university in September 2018. I currently have four graduate students in my lab and my first MSc student is about to graduate. I've also had 12 undergraduates come through. I love teaching students how to be scientists in my lab: from designing their first experiments, to collecting data, learning how to analyze it and finally communicating their results. Outside of my lab, I have been developing courses for undergrad and grad students in computational data analysis and scientific communication.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

My lab is about to start data collection for what we hope will be a long-term research program in vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infections). We have found fantastic clinical and research partners in Manitoba and we seek to understand why some women suffer from recurrent infections. In the future I want to better understand the biology of these infections, in the hope we can better treat them. I also want to work toward reducing the barriers that exist for receiving care, and generally act as an advocate for women's health and better understanding chronic conditions.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I think this career path chose me. I can't imagine anything better than having a job where I never stop learning and teaching.

I grew up in Manitoba, and am deeply invested in this university and this province. I want what is best for Manitoba, and that includes wanting to work at an excellent institution. I truly think the University of Manitoba is on the cusp of greatness - there are so many good people here. But we won't get there without a lot more government support. Investing in the university is investing in Manitoba. Even if you only care about economics, it is an investment that will pay itself off many times.
