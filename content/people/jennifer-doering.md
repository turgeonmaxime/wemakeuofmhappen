### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

Fall 2020

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

My main role in the Department of Biological Sciences is teaching our introductory biology and genetics courses, though I occasionally teach plant biology/anatomy courses. It is my goal each semester to instill an appreciation of biology (and especially fungi) in our students and to be a mentor and someone our students can talk to as they adjust to a new learning environment. Outside of teaching, I have been working to reduce accessibility barriers and making our learning environments as safe and inclusive as possible.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I would love to design and deliver a course in Ethnobotany, bringing together the traditional knowledge of Land Keepers and Indigenous communities and western approaches to the field of botany and mycology, in collaboration with Indigenous Scholars and Indigenous communities in Manitoba.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I have always loved teaching and inspiring students, but also learning from students. I believe that teaching is a collaboration between us as educators and the students we educate. I really love seeing students applying what they are learning in the class to real-world applications and developing their critical thinking and recognising the things we are learning in their everyday lives. That spark is so rewarding!
