### When did you join the University of Manitoba?

In 2021

### What do you see as your main contribution to the university?

I use numerical models to understand and make future projections of ocean processes, their interactions with ice and the climate. As the only ocean modeler in the Centre for Earth Observation Science, I help my colleagues that make field observations to explore marine phenomena in places or seasons that they cannot make measurements.

### What impact in the future do you hope to have at the university or in the community?

I hope to form a new generation of numerical modelers that will help society to better prepare for future climatic conditions and marine hazards. One of my research approaches  is to work with Northern communities to explore aspects of the marine environment that directly affect their way of living. For example, by investigating changes in the ocean and sea ice states we can advise what kinds of impacts that might have on fisheries and hunting grounds.

### Why did you choose the career path you did? What do you enjoy most about what you do?

I decided I was going to be an oceanographer when I was 12. I was intrigued by everything involving the natural world, but had a soft spot for ocean exploration. Once I started working in polar regions - first in Antarctica and now in the Arctic - I was completely hooked. These are unique places that significantly affect Earth's climate. However, because of their harsh environment (freezing temperatures, ice everywhere, frequent bad weather), exploring polar oceans is particularly challenging. That is why numerical models are so important to study those regions, and why I thoroughly enjoy improving these models to produce better results. This includes lots of computer coding, and because I'm a bit of a nerd, I have lots of fun doing it!
